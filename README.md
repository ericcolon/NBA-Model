# NBA Predictive Model

The NBA Predictive Model aims to predict the results of NBA games using historical basketball data. Using deep learning frameworks 
such as Keras and Tensorflow, this historical data is fed into a neural network that generates a predictive model. The performance
of this model is then evaluated on previous seasons.

## Getting Started

The setup of this project is relatively simple.<br />
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed: `python3 --version` (if you don't have it, install [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
2. In the project's main directory, run `pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

Once this is done, you can begin experimenting with building a model using various different statistics!
